### Design Rationale

We ended up running into several different issues like the barber just sleeping without checking if there are more customers in the queue, so from there we decided to explicitly design a waiting room. 

We also had confusion when trying to track which customers went where, so we designed an id system where we know which customer is where through reporting which customer id is being served.

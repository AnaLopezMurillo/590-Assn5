- waiting room w/ 6 chairs, barber w/ 1 chair
- barber sleeps when no customer in room
- customers arrive at random times
- customers can enter waiting room and wait for whether barber available or not. this if a FIFO queue
- customers waiting stay until served
- if barber busy, customers wait
- no empty chairs --> customers leave

Receptionist process:
- greets the customer + checks if there are open waiting spaces
- if room to wait, send to barber, else turn away

Barber process:
- add some variability. im thinking we add randomization in how long it takes barber to cut hair to fulfill this

Hot swappability in main barber loop:
- makes stuff alterabl.
- spawning of a customer is hot swap
    - every time customer made we can use the most recent version of the process code
- loop in a customer process NOT hot swapped
    - customer made --> behavior stays the same for its lifetime. but check the latest version when we make a new cust.
